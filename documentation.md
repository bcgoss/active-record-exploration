  * AR Method: Select  
  * Description: Select allows us to return specific columns from a table. It can accept symbols as arguments, an it will return columns with the same name as the symbols. Alternatively, you can pass a string which will be embeded in a SQL Select statement. This is useful for doing calculations or manipulation on each row returned by the select. Select is usually the second method in a chain of Active Record methods, after the table or collection and before methods that transform or limit the result.  
  * Example: Students.select(:name, :email).order(:name); Teachers.select('average(Time.now - hire_date) as seniority');  
  * Anything else?: Select only populates the data you ask for. A collection built from a select method will not include any of the columns not listed.
